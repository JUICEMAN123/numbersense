genRunner is the runner file

qUp__ is each set of question types

eliminateZero is for checking if the zero at the end of a double is needed and auto-removes it if unnessary

range creates a range for randomization between the interval

simplify is for simplifying fractions and putting them into LaTeX format

Currently being tested is OofO's placeholder method, which is meant to take Objects with ranges for each operation and generate an equation and answer for it

the ArrayList questions and answers are for the questions and answers

i is for the question number

The answer key and question numbers may be off, because the questions are generated with the numbers and the answer key is generated at the end.

fracOperations has methods for fraction arithmetic

### To-Do List

- Bugs

    Question numbers doubling up
    
    Questions not fully genning? (questions generating lik 43=)
    
    Answer key being wrong for some problems
    
    idk if this is fixable, but answer key and question numbers not being aligned
    
    I think that sequences isn't adding right
    
    Exponents - I think answer key is wrong and question also needs "$=n^k$, what is $k$"
    
    OofO's placeholder method, not generating a first term for the equation

    Know what Substitution/Word-Problems are

    Simple Interest Problems
    
    Theorems from Geometry - angle bisector, what else?
    
    Complex Numbers, there are a couple of problems with this (question number doubling up, $i$'s not printing)
    
    Unnecessary 0's after doubles

- Spaces after the question number

- balance problems more, i.e. no more $2^2$
